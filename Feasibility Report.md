# Feasibility Report

## Solution Feasibility
This section assesses the feasibility of implementing the proposed solutions based on the data and technical requirements.

### Predictive Maintenance Solution

- **Feasibility**:The solution involves time-series analysis, data preprocessing (handling missing values and time-based feature extraction)
and classification models.

- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Need to preprocess the data, including normalizing sensor readings and handling missing values.
  - Possible need for real-time data pipelines to deploy the model for production use.
  - The models will require tuning and evaluation to ensure they generalize well.

- **GenAI Feasibility**: Traditional machine learning models are sufficient; advanced deep learning models like LSTM may be explored based on dataset size and temporal patterns.



### Demand Forecasting Solution

- **Feasibility**: The retail sales dataset is ideal for demand forecasting. The solution involves aggregating sales data, extracting seasonal features, and training time-series models.

- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Need to clean and aggregate the data into time-series formats (daily, weekly, monthly).
  - For LSTM or deep learning models, a substantial amount of computational resources will be required for training.

- **GenAI Feasibility**: While traditional time-series models like ARIMA are sufficient, deep learning models can capture more complex patterns if computational resources are available.


### Customer Service Chatbot Solution

- **Feasibility**: The dataset is ideal for chatbot model development. The solution involves training a classification model for intent recognition and a response generation model (Seq2Seq or Transformer models).

- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Need to preprocess and tokenize the text data.
  - Use of word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) or transformers (e.g., BERT) for intent classification and response generation.
  - Testing and continuous improvement will be required to ensure high-quality interaction.

- **GenAI Feasibility**: Feasible with pre-trained NLP models (BERT, GPT) to handle real-time queries. Open-source frameworks like Rasa or Dialogflow can simplify deployment.

## 3. Next Steps

### Identifing Additional Data Requirements
- For **Predictive Maintenance**, additional sensor data from other machines could enhance model performance.
- For **Demand Forecasting**, data on special events, holidays, and promotional activities could improve accuracy.
- For **Customer Service Chatbot**, expanding the dataset with more intents, especially for specific use cases, will improve coverage.

### Seting Up Data Pipelines for Viable Solutions
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Implement real-time data collection from sensors and create pipelines for continuous monitoring and model retraining.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Set up automated data aggregation from transaction systems to keep the model up to date with the latest sales data.
- **Customer Service Chatbot**: Set up an interactive data pipeline that allows for continuous learning and improvement of the chatbot's responses based on user interactions.

### Model Testing and Evaluation
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Begin testing with machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest) and evaluate using accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Implement ARIMA or LSTM models and evaluate using forecasting accuracy metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE).
- **Customer Service Chatbot**: Test intent classification accuracy and improve response generation using reinforcement learning or human-in-the-loop methods.
