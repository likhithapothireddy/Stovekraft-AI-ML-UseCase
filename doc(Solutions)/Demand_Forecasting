### Solution for Demand Forecasting:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning the dataset by handling missing or invalid values.
   - Converting `InvoiceDate` into a datetime object and extract time-based features like **month**, **day of week**, etc.
   - Aggregating the data to daily, weekly, or monthly levels for time-series forecasting.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating features for **seasonality**, **holidays**, and **special events** that may affect demand.
   - Extracting **customer behavior patterns** (e.g., frequency of purchases, products bought together).

3. **Modeling**:
   - Using time-series models like **ARIMA** or **SARIMA** to forecast demand.
   - Applying **Prophet** for seasonal adjustments and easy-to-use time-series forecasting.
   - For complex patterns, implement **LSTM** or **GRU** models to capture long-term dependencies.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Measuring forecasting accuracy using **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**, **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**, and **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Developing a demand forecasting model that predicts future sales to optimize inventory levels.
