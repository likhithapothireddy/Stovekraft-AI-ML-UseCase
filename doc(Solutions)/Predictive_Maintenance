### Solution for Predictive Maintenance:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Converting `timestamp` to a datetime object and extract time-based features.
   - Handling missing values in `sensor_1` using imputation techniques (e.g., mean, median).
   - Normalize sensor readings.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Aggregating data over time windows (e.g., hourly, daily) to detect trends.
   - Extracting statistical features (mean, median, standard deviation) from sensor readings.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Training classification models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict the `failure_event`.
   - Exploring deep learning models like **LSTM** if temporal patterns are significant.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Using metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **AUC-ROC**.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Implementing the trained model for real-time failure prediction in a production environment.
